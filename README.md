# task-6
This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flower species using sepal and petal features. Steps include data preprocessing, normalization, train-test split, model training with cross-validation to find best k, evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and decision boundary visualization.
